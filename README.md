# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game for two players. Players take turns entering row and column positions to place their symbol ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 board. The game checks for a winner after each move by evaluating all possible winning combinations. It continues until one player wins, the board is full (draw), or a player quits.
